## 🎯 The Problem

- **430 million people worldwide** need hearing support and rehabilitation  
- **500,000+ people** in the US use American Sign Language  
- Learning ASL is challenging without real-time, personalized feedback  
- Traditional methods (videos, books) lack interactive guidance  
- No way to verify if you're making signs correctly  

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**SignSpace** leverages Apple Vision Pro's advanced hand tracking to provide:

- ✅ **Real-time gesture recognition** – Detects ASL signs with 90Hz precision  
- ✅ **Ghost hands overlay** – Transparent “target” hands show correct position  
- ✅ **Specific, actionable feedback** – “Move your thumb closer to your palm” instead of generic errors  
- ✅ **Progress tracking** – Visual indicators showing mastery of each sign  
- ✅ **Spatial visualization** – 3D hand skeleton with joint-level accuracy
